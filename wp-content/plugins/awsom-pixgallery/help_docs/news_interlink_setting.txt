AWSOM Pixgallery News Interlink setting help

This setting is a special support setting to allow Wordpress admins who are using the ComicPress theme (or want to name their
images in the same fashion) to have Pixgallery create automatic links to any news post that appeared on the same day as the
title date of the image being displayed. If your image is called "2007-05-04.jpg" then any news posts done on that date would
be displayed in series under the full image view of that image.

You can exclude displaying certain authors by adding their WordPress user number into the next box.

If none of these settings or techniques resolves your issue please go to http://www.awsom.org or http://www.harknell.com for more support.
