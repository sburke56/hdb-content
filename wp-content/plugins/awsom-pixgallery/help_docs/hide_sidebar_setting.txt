AWSOM Pixgallery Hide Sidebar setting help

This setting is designed to automatically hide the display of the contents of your Wordpress theme's sidebar.php file from view in order
to allow more room in your theme to display full size images. It uses the most common Wordpress designation for sidebar areas.
If your sidebar is still displayed on full size image pages after enabling this setting, your theme may be using a non-stanadard name
to call your sidebar for display.

If you know the name that is being used to display your sidebar you can manually change the code to add this in to allow this
function to work. In the file pixgallery.php find the following code:

// ***AWSOM mod for hide sidebar Option****//
if ($PixGallery_HideSidebar == 1) {
$Output	.= "<style>#sidebar { display: none; visibility: hidden; }</style>";
}
else{
$Output	.= "<style>#sidebar ul li { text-align: left; }</style>";
}
// ****end mod*** //

and substitute the CSS name fro your sidebar for the text following the # sign (for example if your sidebar is called "sidearea" change 
#sidebar in the code above to say #sidearea. This will then allow the option to work correctly with your setup.
