AWSOM Pixgallery Individual Comments setting help

The Individual Comments setting is a special function that allows the admin to designate if comments are assigned
to specific images and galleries within a Pixgallery Gallery. If this setting is turned on comments left on a page/post
will be attached to the specific gallery or image being viewed when the comment is entered, if this setting is turned off all images and
galleries will display all comments left for that page/post regardless of what image or gallery was being viewed
when the comment was added.

The admin can still disable comments on a particular page or post by using the regular Wordpress allow/disallow comments function.

The best part about this comment system is any normal Wordpress anti-spam comment system *should* work with this system unchanged.

NOTE: Use of this system is only supported on Wordpress versions 2.0.5 and above.

If none of these settings or techniques resolves your issue please go to http://www.awsom.org or http://www.harknell.com for more support.
