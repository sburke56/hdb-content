AWSOM Pixgallery cache folder setting help

This setting determines the location on your server that Pixgallery will use to create the thumbnails and watermarked versions of your images. 
By default Pixgallery will try to create a folder in your wp-content/uploads folder. This is where Wordpress normally stores images uploaded
through the posts or page writing system. As such it's a good location to use to allow for portability of your site should you ever need to move it.
I strongly suggest you resist the urge to move your wp-content folder, it will only cause problems.

The default install makes the folder cache setting as: wp-content/uploads/cache
In most cases this should work fine. If, however, you have issues where thumbnails or watermarked images do not appear properly you may need
to adjust this setting. Typically you may need to add a leading or trailing / symbol to the setting. So /wp-content/uploads/cache or
wp-content/uploads/cache/ or the full /wp-content/uploads/cache/ are three alternative that can be tried to resolve your issue.

If none of the above settings change help your situation you may need to turn on "Absolute linking" to resolve your issue. This is a
setting in the Pixgallery admin area that turns the linking of images into absolute links, as opposed to the normal relative links used by
Wordpress. Another possibility is that your original Pixgallery gallery code placed in your post or page is incorrect.
