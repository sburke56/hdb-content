AWSOM Pixgallery Global Image Reduce setting help

This setting is a special function that allows Wordpress admins to globally reduce the image size of images outside of defined
Pixgallery galleries. This would allow for uploading large format images at high resolution without the need to process the images
first for web usage. This can speed up how fast you get your images up on your site. However, for this setting to work
properly you can not use the built in Wordpress image upload function for posts or pages unless you also manually go in and set the folders
that are created in your wp-content/uploads folder to all be 777 permissions. If you do not do this you will receive an error
statement: Your Image Folder is not Set to the 777 permissions needed to allow Global Resize function to operate
Please be aware that the use of this setting WILL alter your original image files on the server by rewriting them to a smaller size that you
designate.
