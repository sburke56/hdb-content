AWSOM Pixgallery Watermarking Version 1.0 settings help

This series of settings is designed to allow automatic watermaking of your images for display in Pixgallery galleries. Please note that
your original images are NOT altered by this function. New images are created by this function and placed in your cache folder.
The two word overlay settings are affected by the color text setting, which determines the overlay text color. The difference between
the two settings is the Image Word Overlay adds in a white background color behind your text to make it more easily seen if needed.
The Custom Image Watermark setting is a special setting that allows you to supply an image file of your own to use as your
watermark. This file needs to be called "watermark.png" or "watermark.gif" and must be placed in the awsompixgallery/image folder. Example images
are supplied with the plugin, replace these images with your own.

To switch between Watermark settings you MUST delete all of the images in your cache folder. This is the folder designated in the 
Pixgallery admin settings area and also holds your thumbnail images. Once you have deleted the images in that folder Pixgallery
will automatically create your new Watermarked images and thumbnails for your galleries upon the next viewing of the gallery.

If your watermarked images do not display correctly first make sure that you have refreshed your webpage view by forcing your
web browser to reload the page fully. This is typically done by holding the shift key when clicking the reload button in your
browser. If you still can't see your watermarked images, or no image appears, you may need to adjust your cache folder setting, please
see the help file for that setting for more information on this.
