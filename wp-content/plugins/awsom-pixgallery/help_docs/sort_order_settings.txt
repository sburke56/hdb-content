AWSOM Pixgallery Sort Order help

This setting determines how Pixgallery will sort and display your images in galleries. In most cases this setting will work exactly
as described. However some servers will have different ways of determining file order and may cause this setting to appear to work
incorrectly. If you have set this setting and are not getting the sort order you would like try reversing the setting to the reverse
of it's current setting. This is especially true in the case of the "last file"/"first file" added settings. This should correct
the display issue.

If none of these settings or techniques resolves your issue please go to http://www.awsom.org or http://www.harknell.com for more support.
