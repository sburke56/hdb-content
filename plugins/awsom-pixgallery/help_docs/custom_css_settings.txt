AWSOM Pixgallery Custom CSS setting Help File


The Custom CSS Setting field allows you to input any CSS entries you'd like to alter the look of your overall Gallery.
The gallery area is wrapped by a HTML div tag so any CSS that is compatible with the HTML div tag
should work properly (please note that different web browsers may display CSS differently). To input the 
CSS entries simply add the entries directly into the input box as you would inside a CSS file, but do not add in
a { or } before or after them--Just add the actual entries making sure each entry ends with a ;

Here are some examples of what would be directly entered in the input box.

example one single entry:
font-size: 12pt;

example two multiple entry:
color: #00FF00; font-family:arial; 

You can input as many entries as you'd like in a row.
