AWSOM Pixgallery Absolute Lining setting help

The Pixgallery Absolute Linking setting is designed to compensate for a situation where images or thumbnails do not appear in Pixgallery when
the Wordpress install folder is in a sub-folder on a server set to use Fancy Permalinks. Do not use this setting unless both conditions
above are true for your set up, otherwise you may induce a situation where images and thumbnails do not properly appear.

If turning on this setting does not correct your issue you may have a problem with your cache folder setting. Please see the
help file for that setting for options and techniques to correct your issue.

If none of these settings or techniques resolves your issue please go to http://www.awsom.org or http://www.harknell.com for more support.
