AWSOM Pixgallery Limit Pagination Links setting help

The Limit Pagination Links setting allows the admin to limit the number of pagination links that are displayed under the
thumbnail gallery view to a set number. This is usually required when a gallery has many pages and the number of pagination
links gets too large for the Wordpress theme to handle. "..." is displayed in whichever direction there are more pages,
which if clicked advances the gallery to the next set of pages in that direction.
If none of these settings or techniques resolves your issue please go to http://www.awsom.org or http://www.harknell.com for more support.
