AWSOM Pixgallery Debug Mode setting help

This setting turns on the Debug mode for Pixgallery, that will display more information on the Gallery page in order to help resolve
issues or make certain functions easier. One specific thing that this enables is the display of the sort order number for images
and galleries on the thumbnail page so you can see and set images into order easier when using the numerical sort option.

If you have problems with your set up you may need to transmit some of this information to Harknell to help in resolution of your issue.

The new "Advanced" option gives expanded capabilities for this mode. With "Advanced" enabled the admin can now edit the sort order, custom name, and caption for images, and custom name and sort order for subgalleries, right from the thumbnail view and submit all updates at once.
