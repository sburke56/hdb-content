AWSOM Pixgallery Post Scanning setting help

The Pixgallery Post Scanning setting is designed to compensate for a situation where activation of Pixgallery significantly slows down the loading of the index page of WordPress. In some cases (especially with some advertising plugins) Pixgallery will attempt to scan the images of a post and fail (because the images aren't hosted on your server or it doesn't have permission to open the image)--thereby slowing down the entire site. Turn this setting to Yes to stop Pixgallery from scanning Posts which should stop this issue.

Note that the Global resize function will not be able to then work within Posts, but will still work within Pages.
