Written by Harknell

4.7.0	03/25/2011	Add RSS function to plugin (thank you sbilbeau for the initial code concept).
			Fixed and added custom breadcrumb naming for sub folders.

			Added New Plugin Option to "fix" potential conflict situation with some other post/page scanning plugins (reported for YARPP).
			Added Better form notifications of elements that are *required* when adding Image/Gallery Captions.
			Fixed a Sort ordering bug. (so you might need to change your sort order setting….)
			Added Optional image/gallery tags as WordPress header meta keywords output option.
			Added SEO info so images/gallery names can be added to the title tag in the header of page being viewed.
			Revised Path does not exist error message so only Admin's logged in see the actual path (to reduce possibility of regular users seeing privileged info)
			Added Option to advance to next image in gallery if image is clicked (last image pops you back to thumbnail view).
			Added Folder Icon image for galleries in thumbnail view with optional ability to use custom image. (credit for icon image: http://www.fatcow.com/free-icons )
			Added New Admin Front End editing option if Admin Debug mode is set to "advanced".
			Added New "Universal Image Text" option (in the Pixgallery Image Captions Admin Page) that allows admins to set text that displays for all images when viewed.

			Fixed a small text issue with the output when non-admins attempt to access the PixGallery admin page.
			Added exclude by author ability in ComicPress integration (feature request).

4.6.1	06/10/2010	Made slight change to "hide thumbnail text" function to show folder names.
			Reversed default setting for "hide breadcrumb" setting so it's will be displayed by default.
4.6.0	04/13/10	Admin settings/options page rewritten for better clarity and grouping of settings by function.
			Added new Setting to help in cases of Index page slowdown when Pixgallery is active. You can turn off Post Scanning for images.
			Added new language config system using external pixgallery_lang.php file. Will eventually add option for database saving.
			Added new awsom-customizations folder creation (in uploads) during plugin activation so upgrades to the plugin do not overwrite changes already made to language file or the css file.

			Added new option to hide/display the breadcrumb for images/galleries.
			Added new Pixgallery gallery code--use [pixgallery="/myfolder/"][/pixgallery] from now on (old codes will still work though).
